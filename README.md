## Project Overview
This project is a collection of command-line games written in JavaScript. Each game focuses on improving logical thinking and mathematical skills. The games included are:
- Brain-even: Determine if a number is even.
- Brain-calc: Solve basic arithmetic expressions.
- Brain-gcd: Find the greatest common divisor.
- Brain-progression: Identify the missing number in a sequence.
- Brain-prime: Determine if a number is prime.


## Installation
To install and run the games locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aleksabramov77/frontend-project-44.git
   cd frontend-project-44
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the games**:
   After installing, you can start any game by running:
   ```bash
   brain-even
   brain-calc
   brain-gcd
   brain-progression
   brain-prime
   ```

**Note:** Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine.
